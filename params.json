This project will then step by setup replace the file repository implementation with calls to the owncloud api. In order to test this, you can use the OpenCMIS Workbench from http://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFor now I am the only one working on this.
